# SQL-Code-chalenge
With a data BikerDatav2.csv which contains information on bike hailing business,We would write and attach simple SQL query to perform the following basic operations.
•	On which day of the week do we on average have the longest trip?
•	What month/year has the most bike trips and what is the count of the trips?
•	In the same table, return which particular trip has longest duration and the trip that has the shortest duration (return all the information(columns) on the table for this record)
If more than 1 record has the same duration, return the earliest trip [start time]
NB: Exclude 'Missing' and 'Stolen' as values in the end_station_name column.
Exclude trips that start and end at the same station.
Your final output will be 2 rows
